opencv-python>=4.8.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# NOTE: MediaPipe hand tracking is required but has compatibility issues
# MediaPipe 0.10+ removed the 'solutions' API that this project was designed for
# 
# INSTALLATION OPTIONS:
# 1. For Python 3.11 or earlier, you can try:
#    pip install mediapipe==0.9.0.1
# 
# 2. For Python 3.12+, mediapipe 0.10+ is required, but it has breaking changes
#    The project is being updated to support the new API
# 
# 3. As a workaround, you can use:
#    pip install mediapipe cvzone
#    (May have compatibility issues but sometimes works)
#
# For now, install manually based on your Python version:
# mediapipe>=0.8.0,<0.10.0  # For Python 3.11 and below (if available)
# mediapipe>=0.10.0          # For Python 3.12+ (requires code updates)
